# Task: Statistics Calculation

This project performs simple statistical calculations on an array of numbers and displays the results on an HTML page. The calculations include the minimum, maximum, and average values, as well as the median.

## Task Description

As discussed, the task is to perform simple calculations in JavaScript and output the results in HTML. Specifically, you need to:

1. Determine the minimum value in the array.
2. Determine the maximum value in the array.
3. Calculate the average (mean) value of the array.
4. As an additional task, calculate the median value of the array.

## Excercise Data

The array of numbers to be used for the calculations is:

const inputData = [
    63.24, 33.32, 85.94, 50.23, 86.39, 42.00, 20.05, 92.44, 37.14, 18.80,
    67.65, 35.09, 60.77, 71.07, 32.50, 90.44, 58.11, 76.19, 42.90, 71.69,
    36.09, 36.16, 14.91
];
